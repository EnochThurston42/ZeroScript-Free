# Changelog

All notable changes to ZeroScript Free are documented here.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- **ChatGPT: the operating instructions are now re-stated periodically.** ChatGPT
  summarises its own context mid-session, and the part it drops first is the
  *mechanism* - that an extension reads its replies and really runs them. It
  would then answer "I can't invoke those commands in this session" while the
  extension sat there, ready. The full instructions are now re-sent
  automatically, riding along on a tool result so they cost no extra message and
  stay hidden from you (they appear as a "Reminder" chip). A tool result is
  never shortened to make room: if the pair would not fit, the reminder simply
  waits for the next one. ChatGPT only - no other provider needs it.
- **ChatGPT: an image you send is now treated as reference material.** Unless you
  explicitly ask for a picture, ChatGPT used to answer a screenshot or a mockup
  by *generating a new image* instead of doing the work it was meant to
  illustrate - and its image tool cannot reach your place anyway.

### Fixed
- **ChatGPT: you can chat normally again without starting an agent.** On a blank
  ChatGPT tab the extension refused to let a message send until you clicked
  "Start Roblox agent". Every other provider only suggests it; ChatGPT was the
  odd one out.
- **A finished command is no longer stranded as "not run".** After a long reply
  (seen on Qwen writing for 400s and more) the loop could give up while the model
  was still going; eight seconds later the completed command was written off for
  good. That window is now three minutes, so the command actually runs.
- **A clear message when ZeroScript is updated while a tab is open.** Chrome
  updates extensions underneath open tabs, which leaves the page running a
  version that no longer exists. ZeroScript reported this as "the bridge stopped
  on your PC - run start.bat", sending you to fix something that was never
  broken. It now says plainly that the page needs reloading, and offers a Reload
  button - your bridge and Studio are untouched.
- **The AI no longer claims your bridge is offline without checking.** After one
  momentary outage it would keep repeating "Roblox is offline" from memory, even
  once everything was back. It must now actually run a command before saying so.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- **ChatGPT support (chatgpt.com).** ZeroScript now runs on ChatGPT as an
  eighth provider. Image input is deliberately disabled there: ChatGPT's free
  tier caps files/images on a separate quota from messages, so vision would
  work only part of the day. Reasoning mode ("Analyser") and the model picker
  are left entirely to you.

### Fixed
- **Meta AI: fixed large commands failing with "bad JSON".** Meta renders a
  ```json block as an interactive viewer whose default *Tree* view does not
  merely decorate the JSON - it **abridges** it: a large array or object is
  replaced by a summary placeholder. A 19103-character `multi_edit` was present
  in the page as 223 characters ending in `"edits":[1 item]`, so ZeroScript sent
  the parser a truncated object and the command came back as a parse error every
  time. This is also why the tool chip's token counter climbed while the reply
  streamed and then **collapsed to about 44 tokens** the moment the block
  finished rendering - the counter was faithfully reporting what could be read.
  Command blocks are now switched to the viewer's *Raw* tab, which holds the
  verbatim source; the 19103-character payload is read whole.
- **Clearer diagnosis when Roblox refuses to parse Luau.** "Failed to parse
  command code" is Studio's generic parse rejection, but ZeroScript always
  answered it with "your code block was empty or the marker was wrong". When a
  full code string *had* been sent, that advice pointed the model at a problem
  that did not exist, so it re-sent the same payload and failed again. The hint
  now only mentions the `###LUA###` markers when the code really was empty, and
  otherwise reports how many characters were sent and names the real causes -
  invalid syntax, or code too large/complex for the parser. (Measured live: a
  `return 1+1+1+…` chain ran at 1006 characters and was rejected at 2006.)
- **ChatGPT: fixed most tool calls failing outright.** ChatGPT renders code
  blocks with CodeMirror, which puts one element per line and **no newline
  characters at all** in the page. Reading a reply the usual way therefore
  returned the whole script glued onto a single line, so a perfectly valid
  command came back as "Failed to parse command code / your code block was
  empty", and the calls that did run reported every Luau error on line 1.
  Replies are now read with the line structure preserved.
- **ChatGPT: fixed long commands being executed truncated.** Beyond roughly
  2000-4000 characters, CodeMirror only renders *part* of a long line and the
  rendered text then stays frozen while the model keeps writing - the tool
  chip's token counter would climb, drop back to about 500 tokens, freeze
  there, and the command would run cut off. Measured live: a 21273-character
  command of which the page exposed 4049. ZeroScript now reads the editor's
  real document instead of the rendered page, through a new MAIN-world tap
  (`providers/chatgpt-cm.js`), the same approach already used for Qwen's
  Monaco editor. A 5.3k-token `multi_edit` now applies whole.
- **ChatGPT: fixed the raw command staying visible.** When the model writes a
  command without wrapping it in a code fence, ChatGPT splits it into dozens of
  sibling paragraphs (68 of them for a 208-line script) and only the first one
  carried the marker, so the rest of the script stayed on screen. The whole
  marker-to-marker range is now hidden, including while it streams.
- **Fixed the agent dying silently when the model called a tool the
  function-calling way.** A reply like
  `{"toolName": "get_studio_state", "studio_id": "…"}` names a real tool but
  uses the wrong key, so nothing recognised it as a command: the turn was
  finalised as a plain-text answer and the loop simply ended, leaving the agent
  looking frozen (seen on ChatGPT in a long session). ZeroScript now spots a
  known tool named under `toolName` / `tool` / `name` / `function` / `action`
  and asks the model to rewrite it with the proper envelope, exactly as it
  already did for a missing `###LUA###` opener or bare parameters. Prose that
  merely mentions a tool name is not affected - the check requires a tool that
  is really in the catalogue.
- **Fixed the "Agent is working…" cover hanging past the composer on the first
  send.** Injecting the system prompt grows the composer, the page gains a
  scrollbar and the content column narrows, so the composer slides sideways -
  and a site that animates that move updates its layout after the cover has
  already been placed, leaving it a frame behind (28px past the card's right
  edge on ChatGPT). The cover is now clamped to the composer card, so a stale
  measurement can never be seen. Only the first send was affected, because the
  composer stops moving once it is docked at the bottom.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **Backgrounding the AI tab no longer strands a pending command as a grey
  "not run".** `waitForResponse` now parks entirely while the tab is hidden and
  shifts every internal deadline (inactivity timeout, warm-up, text-stability,
  etc.) forward by the parked duration, instead of letting them keep ticking
  off-screen. `waitVisible` switched from polling to listening for
  `visibilitychange` - Chrome clamps chained background timers to one tick per
  minute after 5 minutes hidden, which used to delay the resume by up to a
  minute. The bar now shows a **Paused** state while parked, and a genuinely
  empty reply from the site now shows a banner instead of ending the loop
  silently.
- **Gemini: fixed the page freezing (nothing clickable) on a large tool
  result.** Gemini's composer inserts text line by line, synchronously, on the
  main thread - a 2599-line `http_get` result froze the page for about a
  minute. Outgoing text is now capped (120k chars / 1200 lines, head and tail
  kept) and the insert yields to the browser every 120 lines.
- **Gemini: fixed the system prompt occasionally never leaving the composer on
  Start.** The wedged-stop-button detector latches for 2 seconds from the
  first time it sees a stop button, so the single recovery attempt at boot -
  the very first sighting - was refused by its own guard. It now retries
  across that window and retypes as a last resort.
- **Kimi: fixed the model picker opening and closing in a loop.** Kimi's K3
  update removed the model (K2.6) the default-model routine used to select,
  so it kept hunting for a row that no longer exists. It now only acts when
  the current model is **K3 Swarm** (matched by name, any UI language) and
  gives up after a few tries instead of looping. The native-agent warning
  guard was equally broken by the same update and now reads the model label
  at its new location.
- **Degraded mode (Roblox Studio closed, running on an addon server only)
  starts much faster.** The tool catalogue request blocks until timeout when
  Roblox is down, and the boot sequence called it three times in a row. Added
  a 30s cache on the catalogue and cut the request timeout from 25s to 10s.
